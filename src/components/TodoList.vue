    <h2>How did you Taekwon-do that???</h2>
    <h5>March 14th, 2021 / LEAVE A COMMENT</h5>

    <p>I first began Taekwondo On November 10th, 2020 for two reasons: 1st reason out of sheer boredom and the 2nd reason was that my cousin announced on Facebook that he just got his blackbelt after 4.5 years. Sooooo naturally I guess I thought it was time for me to take part. From November through March 4th, I trained as a white belt and earned my skill stripes accordingly. On March 5th, I tested for my yellow belt and passed! I am currenly a yellow belt in training! I am having so much fun. I thoroughly enjoy moving my body.</p>

    <p>I got into dirt biking literally right after watching this show called Charm City Kings lol. That was pretty much the breaking point. I good friend of mine rides/races bikes all the time. He's shared pics and videos of his experiences with me over the past couple of years. Intrigued by this, I was unknowling developing an interest for riding bikes....dirt bikes that is. I had my first lesson on January Saturday, January 16th, 2021 and I never looked back. I had my second ride on Saturday, March 6th, 2021. I think it's safe to say that I'm addicted lol. I can't wait to do it again!!!</p>
