<h2>How did you Taekwon-do that???</h2>
<h5>March 14th, 2021 / LEAVE A COMMENT</h5>

<p>I first began Taekwondo on November 10th, 2020 for two reasons: the 1st reason was out of sheer boredom and the 2nd reason was that my cousin recently announced on Facebook that he earned his blackbelt after 4.5 years. Sooooo naturally I guess I thought it was time for me to commit myself to the martial arts. From November through March 4th, I trained as a white belt and earned my skill stripes accordingly. On March 5th, I tested for my yellow belt and passed! I am currenly a yellow belt in training! I am having so much fun and I thoroughly enjoy moving my body.</p><br>
